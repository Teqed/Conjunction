## Base controller responsible for the pathfinding state and movement of a gamepiece.
##
## A controller is responsible for all gamepiece behaviour, especially movement. The base controller
## provides several utility methods that query the [Gameboard]/[Gamepiece] state.
##
## [br][br]Please note that the GamepieceController class doesn't [i]do[/i] anything. Specific
## controllers will usually be subclassed from this base class. See [PlayerController] for a
## detailed example.
##
## [br][br]Requires a gamepiece as parent. The controller is derived from Node2D to account for
## [member global_scale] when searching for paths/objects.
## [br][br][b]Note:[/b] The controller is an optional component. Only gamepieces requiring player
## input or AI will be controlled.
